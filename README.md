# rey-servlet-core-framework

My core framework with servlet + jetty + hapax
### The same anotations like Spring @RController, @RRequestMapping, @RResponseBody but realy lightweight.
It 's so simple, just take a look at test package and you will know how to use it
P/s: The character "R" is just my nickname - ReydentX
