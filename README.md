# rey-servlet-core-framework

My custome servlet framework with servlet + jetty + hapax
### The same anotations like Spring: @RController, @RRequestMapping, @RResponseBody but really lightweight.
It 's so simple, just take a look at test package and you will know how to use it. <br />
P/s: The character "R" is just my nickname - ReydentX
